# OpenWeatherMap PowerShell Module

This is a little module to help you get some weather in your Powershell prompt!

![Example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/563819/17722041/ab4372a4-63f4-11e6-8b7f-bd8e4a60a4d3.png)

# Install

From the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com):

    PS> Install-Module OpenWeatherMap

# Usage

You will need an account on [http://openweathermap.org](http://openweathermap.org) and the API key, it's free to create.

## Unicode Symbols

You may need to use a prompt that supports Unicode characters such as [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) in order to see the weather
symbols.

## Example Profile

See **profile.example.ps1** for an example of a profile that writes the above output. 
See [How to customize your PowerShell profile](http://www.howtogeek.com/50236/customizing-your-powershell-profile/).

```powershell
# Import module from current folder
Import-Module .\OpenWeatherMap

# Import weather from global module path ($env:PSModulePath)
# Import-Module OpenWeatherMap

Function Write-LocalWeatherCurrent([switch]$Inline) {
    # Replace city and API key
    Write-WeatherCurrent -City Minneapolis -ApiKey xxx -Units imperial -Inline:$Inline
}

Function Write-LocalWeatherForecast($Days = 1) {
    # Replace city and API key
    Write-WeatherForecast -City Minneapolis -ApiKey xxx -Units imperial -Days $Days
}

# EXAMPLE: Write at startup
Write-Host "Weather: " -NoNewline -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-LocalWeatherCurrent

# Type `weather` in the prompt to see current weather
Set-Alias weather Write-LocalWeatherCurrent
# Type `forecast` or `forecast -d 2` to get the current forecast
Set-Alias forecast Write-LocalWeatherForecast

# EXAMPLE: Override prompt and include inline weather
Function Prompt() {
    # Write current dir
    Write-Host ($PWD) -NoNewline -ForegroundColor Red
    # Write inline weather
    Write-LocalWeatherCurrent -Inline
    Write-Host "â€º" -NoNewline -ForegroundColor Gray

    return ' '
}
```

This adds a `weather` and `forecast` alias to your PowerShell profile with local weather. It also shows how to override the
built-in prompt to add an inline weather banner.

# Cmdlets

## Raw API Functions

These functions return the raw JSON objects from the OpenWeatherMap API

### `Get-WeatherCurrentRaw -City <name[,country code]> -ApiKey <appid> -Units <imperial|metric|kelvin> [-Proxy <uri>] [-ProxyCredential <PSCredential] [-ProxyUseDefaultCredentials]`

Returns the raw weather city object from the API for you to do whatever you want. 
Uses the [Current Weather API](http://openweathermap.org/current).

### `Get-WeatherForecastRaw -City <name[,country code]> -ApiKey <appid> -Units <imperial|metric|kelvin> [-Proxy <uri>] [-ProxyCredential <PSCredential] [-ProxyUseDefaultCredentials]`

Returns the raw weather city object from the API for you to do whatever you want. 
Uses the [Current Weather API](http://openweathermap.org/current).

## Work with API objects

### `Get-WeatherCityTemperature -City <WeatherCity> -Units <imperial|metric|kelvin>`

Gets the current temp in the provided weather city object (provided by `Get-WeatherCurrentRaw` or `Get-WeatherForecastRaw`)

### `Get-WeatherCityStatus -City <WeatherCity> [-Symbol]`

Gets the current weather status (clear, rainy, snowy) in the provided weather city object (provided by `Get-WeatherCity`).
Pass in `-Symbol` switch to retrieve the weather symbol for a city.

## Helpful utilities

### `Get-WeatherSymbol -Code <weather code>`

Gets a Unicode symbol for the given weather code. Only a limited set available in Windows 10.

### `Write-WeatherCurrent -City <name[,country code]> -ApiKey <appid> -Units <imperial|metric|kelvin> [-Inline]`

Displays a colorful banner in the console (useful for startup). The `-Inline` switch makes it compact for use in the prompt.

### `Write-WeatherForecast -City <name[,country code]> -Days <num> -ApiKey <appid> -Units <imperial|metric|kelvin>`

Displays a colorful weather forecast for given amount of days (including today). Defaults to including tomorrow (1 day).

### `Get-WeatherForecastSummaryForDay -Times <Hashtable[]>`

Summarizes a set of forecasts during a day to the closest one to midday
